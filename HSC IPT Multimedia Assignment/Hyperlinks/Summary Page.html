      <p>After having reviewed through all 5 software development approaches its evident that some approaches are similar to others whilst some are very different. All approaches have the same aim; to develop new software and resolve past issues from older software, each with their own procedure to do so. Within this page we will go over how each approach is different and a comparison.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>The agile and prototyping approach are similar in that they both release working versions quickly, however, the agile approach releases every new iteration with each new change made whereas the prototyping approach makes multiple versions but none are released expect for the final finished product.</p>
      <p>The structured approach is the only approach which follows a rigid flow through the development cycle, whilst every other approach doesn't have any formal stages. This approach is best matched with the prototyping approach when combining the properties of multiple approaches. </p>
      <p>The RAD and prototyping approach are opposite when considering how long it takes to develop new software. The RAD approach aims to release working software in the shortest time possible whereas the prototyping approach is the slowest as the contant modifications are made and numerous prototype versions are designed prior to releases the final product.</p>
      <p>The End-User approach is the only approach which allows the user to develop their own software from scratch using off-the-shelf programs, whereas every other approach includes the involvement from professional programmers to develop software for the user based on their requirements. </p>
      <p>Each approach has their own advantages and disadvantages for use, it is crucial to consider multiple factors such as, the budget, time limit and system requirements prior to choosing the most appropriate approach to use as whichever is selected will greatly affect the end result and development procedure throughout.</p>
      <p>Below is a short video and audio clip which summarises each approach:</p>
      <p><strong>*NOTE -</strong> the video uses different names for each approach but explains the pros and cons of each. </p>
